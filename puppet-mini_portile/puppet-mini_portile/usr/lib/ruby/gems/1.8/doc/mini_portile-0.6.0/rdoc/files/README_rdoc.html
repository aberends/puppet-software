</ul>
<p>
This project is a minimalistic, simplistic and stupid implementation of a
port/recipe system <b>for developers</b>.
</p>
<h2>Another port system, srsly?</h2>
<p>
No, is not a general port system, is not aimed to take over apt, macports
or anything like that.
</p>
<p>
The rationale is simple.
</p>
<p>
You create a library A that uses B at runtime or compile time. Target
audience of your library might have different versions of B installed than
yours.
</p>
<p>
You know, <em>Works on my machine</em> is not what you expect from one
developer to another.
</p>
<p>
Developers having problems report them back to you, and what you do then?
Compile B locally, replacing your existing installation of B or simply
hacking things around so nothing breaks.
</p>
<p>
All this, manually.
</p>
<p>
Computers are tools, are meant to help us, not the other way around.
</p>
<p>
What if I tell you the above scenario can be simplified with something like
this:
</p>
<pre>
  rake compile B_VERSION=1.2.3
</pre>
<p>
And your library will use the version of B you specified. Done.
</p>
<h2>You make it sound easy, where is the catch?</h2>
<p>
You got me, there is a catch. At this time (and highly likely will be
always) <a href="../classes/MiniPortile.html">MiniPortile</a> is only
compatible with GCC compilers and autoconf/configure-based projects.
</p>
<p>
It assumes the library you want to build contains a <tt>configure</tt>
script, which all the autoconf-based libraries do.
</p>
<h3>How to use</h3>
<p>
Now that you know the catch, and you&#8216;re still reading this, let me
show you a quick example:
</p>
<pre>
  require &quot;mini_portile&quot;
  recipe = MiniPortile.new(&quot;libiconv&quot;, &quot;1.13.1&quot;)
  recipe.files = [&quot;http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/libiconv/libiconv-1.13.1.tar.gz&quot;]
  recipe.cook
  recipe.activate
</pre>
<p>
That&#8216;s all. <tt>cook</tt> will download, extract, patch, configure
and compile the library into a namespaced structure. <tt>activate</tt>
ensures GCC find this library and prefers it over a system-wide
installation.
</p>
<h3>Structure</h3>
<p>
At this time, if you haven&#8216;t digged into the code yet, are wondering
<em>what is all that structure talk about?</em>.
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/MiniPortile.html">MiniPortile</a> follows the principle
of <b>convention over configuration</b> and established a folder structure
where is going to place files and perform work.
</p>
<p>
Take the above example, and let&#8216;s draw some picture:
</p>
<pre>
  mylib
    |-- ports
    |   |-- archives
    |   |   `-- libiconv-1.13.1.tar.gz
    |   `-- &lt;platform&gt;
    |       `-- libiconv
    |           `-- 1.13.1
    |               |-- bin
    |               |-- include
    |               `-- lib
    `-- tmp
        `-- &lt;platform&gt;
            `-- ports
</pre>
<p>
In above structure, <tt>platform</tt> refers to the architecture that
represents the operating system you&#8216;re using (e.g. i686-linux,
i386-mingw32, etc).
</p>
<p>
Inside this folder, <a href="../classes/MiniPortile.html">MiniPortile</a>
will store the artifacts that result from the compilation process. As you
cans see, it versions out the library so you can run multiple version
combination without compromising these overlap each other.
</p>
<p>
<tt>archives</tt> is where downloaded source files are stored. It is
recommended you avoid trashing that folder so no further downloads will be
required (save bandwidth, save the world).
</p>
<p>
The <tt>tmp</tt> is where compilation is performed and can be safely
discarded.
</p>
<p>
Don&#8216;t worry, you don&#8216;t need to know the path structure by
memory, just use recipe&#8216;s <tt>path</tt> to obtain the full path to
the installation directory:
</p>
<pre>
  recipe.cook
  recipe.path # =&gt; /home/luis/projects/myapp/ports/i686-linux/libiconv/1.13.1
</pre>
<h3>How can I combine this with my compilation task?</h3>
<p>
In the simplified proposal, the idea is that using Rake, your
<tt>compile</tt> task depends on <a
href="../classes/MiniPortile.html">MiniPortile</a> compilation and most
important, activation.
</p>
<p>
Take the following as a simplification of how you can use <a
href="../classes/MiniPortile.html">MiniPortile</a> with Rake:
</p>
<pre>
  task :libiconv do
    recipe = MiniPortile.new(&quot;libiconv&quot;, &quot;1.13.1&quot;)
    recipe.files = [&quot;http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/libiconv/libiconv-1.13.1.tar.gz&quot;]
    checkpoint = &quot;.#{recipe.name}-#{recipe.version}.installed&quot;

    unless File.exist?(checkpoint)
      recipe.cook
      touch checkpoint
    end

    recipe.activate
  end

  task :compile =&gt; [:libiconv] do
    # ...
  end
</pre>
<p>
This example will:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Compile the library only once (using a timestamp file)

</li>
<li>Ensure compiled library gets activated every time

</li>
<li>Make compile task depend on compiled library activation

</li>
</ul>
<p>
For your homework, you can make libiconv version be taken from <tt>ENV</tt>
variables.
</p>
<h3>Native or cross-compilation</h3>
<p>
Above examples cover the normal use case: compile support libraries
natively.
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/MiniPortile.html">MiniPortile</a> also covers another
use case, which is the cross-compilation of the support libraries to be
used as part of a binary gem compilation.
</p>
<p>
It is the perfect complementary tool for rake-compiler and it&#8216;s
<tt>cross</tt> Rake task.
</p>
<p>
Depending on your usage of rake-compiler, you will need to use
<tt>host</tt> to match the installed cross-compiler toolchain.
</p>
<p>
Please refer to the examples directory for simplified and practical usage.
</p>
<h3>Supported scenarios</h3>
<p>
As mentioned before, <a href="../classes/MiniPortile.html">MiniPortile</a>
requires a GCC compiler toolchain. This has been tested against Ubuntu, OSX
and even Windows (RubyInstaller with DevKit)
